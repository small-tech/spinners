### Fixed

  - The default size of the spinners is now actually `1em` as advertised.

## [2.0.0] - 2020-07-06

### Changed

  - __Breaking change:__ Lines spinner is now scaled so it takes up the full space of the SVG. This should make it easier to match to other icons when presented at the same size.

Initial release.
